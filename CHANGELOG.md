# Change Log
All notable changes to the serverless-express-typescript boilterplate will be documented in this file.

The format is based on **Keep a Changelog** and this project adheres to Semantic Versioning (`semver`).

# How to use
In each changelog record, we use these keywords as part of the template description:
1. `recommended` - to notify plugin user that it is a `stable` plugin version, we highly recommend downloading and use.
2. `optional` - to notify plugin user that it is not necessary to download this plugin version, `optional` to download and use.

Why are we following these keywords? Our `semver` practices interpreted differently, our `minor` and `patch` versions are "mixed".
